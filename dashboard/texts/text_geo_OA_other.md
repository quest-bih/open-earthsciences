The other research outputs, other than scientific journal articles, are divided into five categories: 

- book
- book chapter
- conference abstract
- conference paper
- and other. 

The "other" category includes, for example, book reviews, project reports, chapters in textbooks, or electronic supplementary material.

It should be noted that the representation of the OA (Open Access) status of other publishing formats can be distorted. For example, the six chapters with Gold OA status published in the same Gold OA book in 2021.
