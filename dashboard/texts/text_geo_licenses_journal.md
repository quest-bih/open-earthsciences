This graphic shows the distribution of open licenses (as most common Creative Commons (CC) licenses) used for open access journal ("gold", "green", "hybrid" and "bronze") articles displayed in the graphic above. 

Creative Commons offers various standard licenses that provide different degrees of openness to publications. Freie Universit√§t Berlin recommends strongly to its researchers to use the most open licence - CC BY 4.0 DEED (Attribution 4.0 International), which allows researchers to openly share and adapt material for any purpose under the term of attribution (= credit to the author, link to the license and references to changes made).
