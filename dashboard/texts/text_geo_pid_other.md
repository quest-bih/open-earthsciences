A Persistent identifier (or PID) is a long-lasting reference to a digital resource. Persistent identifiers can be created for journal articles, book chapters, research data, but also for people, organisations projects and many more digital entities. Persistent Identifiers and their metadata are becoming increasingly important in the Open Science infrastructure. They are machine-readable and enable greater discoverability and transparency.  

These diagrams show the uptake of PIDs in the Institute of Geological Sciences, Geographical Sciences and Meteorology.
