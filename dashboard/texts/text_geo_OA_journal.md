This graphic shows the Open Access share in scientific journal articles for the years 2016-2022 for the three institutes of the Department of Earth Sciences at the Freie Universität Berlin:

- Institute of Geological Sciences (WE 1)

- Institute of Geographical Sciences (WE 2)

- Institute of Meteorology (WE 3)

The share of journal articles which are available Open Access are shown in green colours, closed-access articles are shown in dark blue. 
Providing Open Access to articles can take several routes, therefore, we distinguished so called “gold”, “green”, and “bronze” Open-Access-articles. This may be of interest to e.g. Open Science specialists who aim for a deeper analysis of publication processes. 
This <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access'>page</a> provides a description of the different Open Access statuses.
