This chart shows the distribution of open data cases by type of repository/website where the data was shared.

General-purpose repositories/websites (or generalist repositories) such as Zenodo, Dryad, Mendeley Data, Figshare or OSF, provide a service to upload both data and software for any discipline. Versioning control and connection to GitHub or original publication help to improve visibility.

Disciplinary repositories/websites are individual for most of the disciplines, and are useful only for the specific community. In case of Geosciences, such repositories like XY, YZ, ZX are declared as most common in the following screening.

The current Open Data criteria used for validation does not count <b>supplements</b> of the article as open data (unless they were shared independently of the article in a data deposit location).

79 articles with openly shared data were automatically detected. This corresponds to 15.6% of the articles (only with available PDFs). XY% (Z articles) of 79 articles have been approved to have Open Data in a manual validation procedure.
